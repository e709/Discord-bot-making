Observation:
If you are following me, you must have noticed that if you click !help by default you will get a command where the bot displays all what it can do. But if you want to create
your own help command look at the following code:

Code:
@client.remove_command('help')#This will remove the help command

@client.command(name='help')
async def on_help():
    await ctx.send('help show this /n!ping says pong /n !pong') #and so on
    
    client.run('Your token here')
